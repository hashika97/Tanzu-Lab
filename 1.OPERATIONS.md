Looking at what are the essential building blocks for your cloud infrastructure transformation. First, digitally-signed CNCF conformant Kubernetes clusters, consistently deployed across clouds, reducing application deployment challenges.  Configuration drift challenges are remediated through a global control plane for Kubernetes cluster deployment, developer self-service & automation pipeline integration, day 2 lifecycle, and centralized visibility for access, network and security polices, and data protection.

A platform-wide observability ensures teams can quickly troubleshoot metrics and distributed tracing in realtime through a time series database with a powerful query engine, extensive out of the box dashboards integrations, and AI Genie for detecting application anomalies.  

Application uptimes and security are further improved by Tanzu Service Mesh for encryption in-transit, Service Level Objective (SLO) enforcement by policy- automating application scale up and down, Global Namespace for extending Kubernetes namespaces across clusters, microservice discovery & dependency graphs, with global service load balancing and advanced traffic routing with integration with NSX Advanced Load Balancer and AWS Route53.
